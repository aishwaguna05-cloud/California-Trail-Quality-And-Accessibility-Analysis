# California-Trail-Quality-And-Accessibility-Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes a large-scale dataset of 15,000+ hiking trails across California to uncover how user sentiment, environmental conditions, and accessibility features influence trail ratings and popularity. The analysis integrates multiple real-world data sources and demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python.

Data Sources
The project combines structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources:
- Trail Metadata: Location, difficulty, length, elevation, and accessibility attributes
- Yelp Reviews: User ratings and review counts as a proxy for trail popularity and sentiment
- Climate Data: Monthly weather conditions affecting trail experience
- Accessibility Records: Indicators for trail usability and inclusivity

Tools & Technologies
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Data Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, aggregation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Key Analysis Highlights
- Processed and cleaned a dataset spanning 12+ attributes and 15,000+ trail records
- Engineered features combining review volume, climate averages, and trail characteristics
- Explored relationships between environmental factors and user ratings
- Built reproducible analysis pipelines within Jupyter Notebook
